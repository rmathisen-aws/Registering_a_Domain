# Registering a Domain

Route 53 is AWS's DNS service.

It allows you to register doamins, so it can bill you and get a domain added \
to a generic TLD (Top-Level Domain), or a country code TLD registry. \
It also provides the ability to host the zone for your domain, \
and it provides managed Nameservers, which actually host that domain on your behalf.

Route 53 offers an end-to-end DNS service!
